# Oak Hill Media Lab – Enhanced (SEN-friendly)

Added features:
- Rubrics & Badges (Gold/Silver/Bronze) per stage
- Certificate generator (HTML → print to PDF)
- Comment threads (teacher ↔ student) per stage
- Guardian (read-only) view linked to a student
- Inline media previews for PDF / image / video
- Stage resource links (paste URLs to your DOCX/PPTX/PDF in Admin → Settings)

## Admin tips
- To create a Guardian, choose role *Guardian* and set "Guardian of" to the student's email.
- Paste your worksheet/slide URLs (e.g. GitHub raw links, Google Drive share links) in Settings so students can open them from stage cards.

## Notes
- For a true PDF export without the print dialog, integrate a client-side PDF lib; this MVP uses the browser print-to-PDF for simplicity.
